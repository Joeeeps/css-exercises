.container .text { 
    background-color:yellow; color:red;
    font-size:20px; text-align: center;
}

/* Initially I did this just by using the div class, as it was nicely set up for it, however the intended solution was
to create the output while taking into consideration the descendant combinators. 

How this updated version works is that it only uses .text classes if they are nested within .container classes
