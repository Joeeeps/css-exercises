/* I initially did this challenge by applying rules to the <button> class and then setting unique
secondary class rules for elements 1 and 2. The challenge however wanted me to group selectors,
which I did by applying general rules to both .element1 and .element2 and then specific rules for
each group... I guess the advantage is it is cleaner code? */
